# Persian Poetry Dataset for NLP & LLM Tasks

This repository contains a curated collection of Persian poems, structured and formatted for use in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language Model (LLM) applications.

Each poet's work is organized into a separate folder, and each poem is stored in its own `.txt` file for easy access, processing, and training.
